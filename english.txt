great role in air purification , The more trees we have the purer the air . Use less chemicals in factories. When the chemicals 
are less, this means that waste is also minimum. Not only the factories but also those who do farming. Most of the pesticides 
and fertilizers used in farms end up in water bodies. It is important to use a reasonable amount that will not be harmful.
The government should also ban the use of polythene because these polyhtene does not decompose and hence pollute the 
environment . Use renewable resources because non renewable are limited they takes million of years in their formation

 people do will do a long way in environmental protection. Encourage them on the importance of reusing and recycling. Encourage
 use of energy savers as well as collecting rain water. It is very important to protect our environment .It is important that all of us
